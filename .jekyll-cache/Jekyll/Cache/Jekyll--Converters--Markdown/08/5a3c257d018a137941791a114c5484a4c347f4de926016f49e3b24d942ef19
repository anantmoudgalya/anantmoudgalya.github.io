I"p	<p>Internship Experience @ CimplyFive Secretarial Services Pvt Ltd.</p>

<p>Hello Everyone! This post details what I had built during my 2 month (Jan-March 2020) period working as an intern for CimplyFive.
We were hired as a team of 2 interns (myself and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayman-shafi-a2630b129/">Ayman Shafi</a>) to work on a use case for the company. According to the Companies Act in 2013, companies in India are required to comply with certain regulations and compliances. So to streamline their process of doing so, CimplyFive offers a comprehensive web platform called BLISS, which can handle all the company’s legal document needs in a nice GUI drag and drop interface and issue alerts when they’re being non compliant.</p>

<p>As a part of BLISS, CimplyFive offers it’s clients a service to digitise their ‘Past Records’. That is, they physically scan the documents, classify them into necessary classes of meetings according to the Companies Act and upload them into the right financial year and meeting type onto BLISS. This is a labor intensive routine and our task was to automate this process and save valuable company time.</p>

<h2 id="tasks-overview">Tasks Overview</h2>

<p>We were given 2 tasks in the form of user stories. <br />
<b>First</b>, to <b>classify documents</b> into their corresponding <b>meeting types</b> (Board Meetings, Shareolder Meetings etc) and their corresponding <b>file types</b> (Meeting Agenda file, Meeting Minutes files, Other pertinent files etc). Post classification these files were to be physically arranged in a specific directory structure to make it easier for domain users to check for correctness. We were also required to generate a classification report post classification to understand reason behind classification and erroneous classification, if any. <br />
<b>Second</b>, to <b>upload these documents</b> according to their corresponding meeting types and financial years onto the company’s BLISS portal and generate a detailed upload report.</p>

<p>To parse and classify PDF documents, I used the Apache-Tika pdf parser’s python wrapper, <a href="https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python">Tika-Python</a>. It can parse PDF files with great accuracy and proved to be the perfect choice for the requirement. <br />
In order to store and query parsed pdf content</p>

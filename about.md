I'm a Computer Science Senior at PES University Electronic City Campus. <br/>
My research interests include data mining, data management systems and software development.
This blog is where I'll be posting about my projects, papers and experiences.
Welcome and stay tuned! :D

### Other interests
I'm a huge basketball aficionado and I look forward to getting on the court to relax and unwind after a tough day.

I also like listening to instumental music. I highly recommend Beethoven's Piano Sonata, "Waldstein".
